----------------------------
## Project Description

> This repository contains a series of projects that I completed as part of the ALX System Engineering track. The projects cover various topics and skills related to system administration, DevOps, and web development.
----------------------------
## Project Purpose

The purpose of these projects is to learn and practice the following skills:

- Sysadmin: how to configure and maintain servers and computer systems
- Bash scripting: how to write scripts to automate tasks and manipulate data
- SSH: how to securely connect and transfer data between remote machines
- Networking: how to understand and troubleshoot network protocols and services
- Webservers: how to set up and manage web servers and applications
- Firewalls: how to protect and monitor network traffic and access
- Web stack debugging: how to identify and fix common errors and issues in web applications
- Database replication: how to replicate data across multiple servers for backup and scalability
----------------------------
## Project Features

Some of the features and tools that I used in these projects are:

- Linux commands and utilities
- Shellcheck and Shellscript linter
- Emacs and Vim editors
- Apache and Nginx web servers
- MySQL databases and queries 
- Puppet and Ansible configuration management tools
- Git and GitHub version control systems
----------------------------
## Project Installation

To install and run these projects, you will need the following:

- A Linux machine or a virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or higher 
- A text editor such as Emacs, Vim or nano
- A web browser such as Chrome or Firefox

-Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/0xTariq-dev/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
```

Change to the project directory and execute the scripts:
```cd alx-system_engineering-devops/<projct name>
./<script name>```

----------------------------
## Project Usage

Each project directory contains a README file that explains the objectives, requirements, and tasks of the project. Each task is a script that performs a specific action or function.
- To run a script, you need to make it executable and then execute it with the ./ prefix. For example:
```
chmod u+x 0-hello_world
./0-hello_world
```
- Some scripts may require arguments or options. You can pass them after the script name. For example:
```
./1-confused_smiley "Hello World"
```
-Some scripts may also produce output or return values. You can redirect them to a file or another command using the > or | operators. For example:
```
./2-hellofile > hello.txt
./3-twofiles | wc -l
```
